## Call Of Duty- Text Analysis Project

The Call of Duty League is an e-sports league based on Activision's Call of Duty video game. At the moment, the league has 13 teams, each having a large number of followers. The marketing team representing the league wants to add a new team called "Cleveland Fire." The company has provided me with a large amount of data.
- 'teamTimeline' FOLDER - this file has one file with 26,781 tweets among 13 teams.
- 'playerTimelines' FOLDER – contains 13 files, one per team, totaling 177,764 tweets.
- 'teamFollowerTimelines' FOLDER – contains 13 files, one per team, a total of 361,440 tweets. This represents a sample of 3600 followers for each team among the followers.
- 'playerFollowerTimelines' FOLDER – contains 61 files, one per player, totally 2,006,995 tweets

The objective is to identify themes or actionable insights that may benefit the company is adding a new team.

#### In order to provide actionable insights and recommendations, I used text mining processes through R-programming.
  - At the end of my analysis I created a presentation.
